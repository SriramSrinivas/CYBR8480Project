# CYBR8480Project
## Executive Project Summary-
 In this project I am planning to develop an android app which collects data from motion sensors, position sensors, and  environment sensors.  The idea is to collect all the possible data available from device sensors store them on elastic search with timestamps. The data will be later used to train and predict user behavior by applying machine learning techniques such as random forest using Tensor Flow.
### Goals :- 
* Collect data from motion sensors, position sensors, and  environment sensors
* Store the collected data in Elastic Search
* Apply Machine Learning using Tensor Flow to predict or observe any pattern from the collected data 

### Merit of the Project:- 
 * Project aims to provide an idea about the information that can be collected from Android Sensors. 
### Application requirements 
## User stories
* As a user, I can download the app
* As a user, I allow which information from the sensors can be shared with the app
* As a user, I can access Elastic search and see the information which has been sent from my device
* As a user I can login to the website and see the machine learning output from the training set
* As a user I can access only the information sahred by my device.

## Misuser stories
* As a misuser, I want to access information not shared by my device
* As a misuser, I want to access the machine learning output of training data not shared by my device
* As a misuser, I want to access all the data collected in elastic search without proper authorization
