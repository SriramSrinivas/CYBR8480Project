# CYBR8480Project
## Executive Project Summary-
 In this project I am planning to develop an android app which collects data from motion sensors, position sensors, and  environment sensors.  The idea is to collect all the possible data available from device sensors store them on elastic search with timestamps. The data will be later used to train and predict user behavior by applying machine learning techniques such as random forest using Tensor Flow.
### Goals :- Collect data from all available sensors in Android and store them in Elastic Search, use the data as training set to predict some information about user behavior.


### Merit of the Project:-
